Revision history for POE-Quickie

0.02  Thu Jun 24 01:21:17 GMT 2010
    - Renamed CopyINC to AltFork (like POE::Component::Generic and other
      modules call this feature) and made it croak if used on Win32
    - Make sure we have reaped the child process before we emit ExitEvent
    - Added an Capture::Tiny-like interface which "blocks" (while running
      other POE code) while executing programs
    - Replaced the shutdown() method with killall()
